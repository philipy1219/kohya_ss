# Kohya's GUI

This repository provides a Linux-focused Gradio GUI for [Kohya's Stable Diffusion trainers](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts). The GUI allows you to set the training parameters and generate and run the required CLI commands to train the model.

If you run on Windows and would like to use the GUI, look into the original repository from https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss.git  
Please refer also to the original repository for changelog and tutorials, consider this is the Linux port and everything just work the same as the Windows port.  

# This port will be publicly updated ONLY if it is stable enough: *if it is "outdated" it means the upstream have introduced regressions* and we will wait for a stable update prior updating our port.
